I've been asked a number of times to recommend restaurants in Manhattan's Chinatown area, which is one of the best food areas of the city. I usually recommend a couple inexpensive places. While this list focuses on Manhattan, it's also true that Queens is becoming the center of Chinese eating in NYC - especially in areas like Flushing.

### Asian Bakery

- Fay Da Bakery on 83 Mott, on the corner of Mott and Canal. Good stuff to get there are taro rolls, baked pork buns, steamed pork buns, baked rice buns, or really anything else that looks good. The red bean bun is also good.

### Dumplings

-  Tasty Dumpling on Mulberry. Great dumplings here, 5 for just a few dollars. When you get them, ask for the chili sauce. Don't take the stuff in little packets that they may offer first; they should give you something that's like a thick red chili paste in a small glass bowl, *not* from a packet that resembles a ketchup packet.

### Steamed buns

- Golden Steamer has a huge variety! Their salted egg yolk bun is a must-have. 

### Meat over rice

- Go to Wah Fung #1 Fast Food on Chrystie. I recommend the pork over rice or duck over rice.

### Dim Sum

- Nom Wah Tea House on Doyers. This is the best combination of good quality, delicious food, and inexpensive prices as far as dim sum goes. Their dim sum hours are longer than other places. We really love it here. The line moves faster than it looks.
- Jing Fong on Elizabeth. This is a more traditional Dim Sum setup. You'll get seated at a table for 8, potentially with other people if you're a smaller party. Servers will walk around with carts full of food and stop next to you. If you want something you can point to it; otherwise just say no and they'll keep moving. 
  - If you're in Flushing, Asian Jewels is similar to Jing Fong.

All these places are relatively inexpensive.
