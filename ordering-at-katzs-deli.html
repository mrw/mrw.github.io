		<p><a href="https://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/">Katz&#39;s Deli</a> has the best pastrami in NYC, and maybe in the world. Everyone should go there when they visit New York. Here&#39;s how to make the best of your visit:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>When you go in they&#39;ll give you a ticket. Don&#39;t lose the ticket; anything you order has to be put on it so they know what to charge you later.</li>
		<li>Go directly to the counter on the right. Don&#39;t sit on the left; don&#39;t do waiter service. </li>
		<li>Each cutter/slicer has their own line. The line on the closest one is usually longest because people don&#39;t realize that. So move in a little bit.</li>
		<li>While waiting in line, have visible cash in your hand as a tip. A few singles, maybe a $5 if you&#39;re ordering for more than one person. <strong>Make sure to tip your cutter</strong>.</li>
		<li>When it&#39;s your turn, walk up to the cutter and make sure they see you put the cash in their cup. This should happen before you order.</li>
		<li><strong>Your order is a pastrami on rye with mustard. Ask for it juicy (fatty)</strong>. If you&#39;re getting two sandwiches, corned beef on rye with mustard or russian dressing so you can split with people you&#39;re with is also good.<ul>
		<li>Don&#39;t get white bread.</li>
		<li>Don&#39;t get ketchup.</li>
		<li>Don&#39;t get mayo. </li>
		<li>Don&#39;t ask for it lean.</li>
		<li>A reuben is fine as well.</li>
		<li>A roll is acceptable.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Your cutter will give you some slices and pieces on a plate while he&#39;s preparing the sandwich. Grab and eat them with your hands. </li>
		<li>You definitely want pickles. <strong>I prefer sour pickles</strong> but I understand not everyone feels that way.</li>
		<li>Once you get your sandwich, give your ticket so they can mark it.</li>
		<li>Take your sandwich and go in a little more to the drinks area. <strong>Your drink order is a Dr. Brown&#39;s Black Cherry Soda, Dr. Brown&#39;s Cream Soda, or Dr. Brown&#39;s Cel-ray Soda.</strong></li>
		<li>Want something on the side? Potato salad is good, but <strong>a hot dog or knish is even better</strong>.<ul>
		<li>The only acceptable way to eat a hot dog is <strong>&quot;with mustard and sauerkraut&quot;</strong>. </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Go find a seat! Make sure to sit in the &quot;self-serve&quot; tables. There are more if you go around to the side/back.</li>
		<li>On your way out, you&#39;ll pay at the register by presenting your ticket.</li>
		</ol>
